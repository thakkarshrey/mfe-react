--> Auth app is just for signing in and signing up the users. Thats it.
--> Auth app is not for enforcing permissions, allowing access to certain routes or figuring out if the user is signed in or not.

--> Two approaches for handling auth:
1. Each app is aware of auth
2. Centralize auth in container

--> Option 1 requires the auth logic in all of the sub apps which means a lot of duplication of code. So we will be focusing on option 2.

                           |             Container             |
                           |  isAuthenticated --> true/false   |
                           |___________________________________|
                __________________________|______________
               | onSignIn()                              | isAuthenticated
         ______|______                          _________|_______
        |   Auth App  |                        |  Dashboard App  |                                
        |_____________|                        |_________________|


--> We will be passing onSignIn function from Container to Auth app as a callback function. As soon as the user authenticates then we will call the function and it will change the state of isAuthenticated state inside the Container.
--> We can pass the same state to the Dashboard app and check wether the user is authenticated or not and act accordingly.
